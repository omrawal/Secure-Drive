  <h3 class="margin">What is Secure Drive?</h3>
  <p>
    We use drive to store our important documents, records, images as well as memos.<br> So
it is a repository where the user can store, view, edit as well as download their own files
as and when required.<br> But the major disadvantage of these drives is that there is always
a sole administrator which has access to all the accounts.<br> So in case of any suspicious
or malicious activity, he/she(admin) can have a look at our account. <br>This enhanced us
to engender an idea to implement a secure drive which will value the highly rated<br> motto
of furtiveness as well as privacy which is the most desired principle in today’s era.
  </p>
  <h3 class="margin">How does Secure Drive Work?</h3>
  <p>
    Overcome the problem of Administrator’s access to the contents of Database even
    though <br>the contents are restricted to the authenticated user. Hence to overcome this
    issue the files will be stored in an encrypted<br> format and the contents will not be visible
    to the Administrator. Also to keep the files secured from unauthorized users or any
    malicious activity, <br>the Drive will be immune to attacks and penetrations using
    encryption and two-step authentication.
